# 📊 Progress Bar Features

Enhanced ipip with comprehensive progress indicators for better user experience during file operations.

## 🚀 What's New

### File Scanning Progress
- **Scanning Progress**: Shows live count of files being discovered
- **Smart Display**: Only shows for larger operations or in verbose mode
- **Time Tracking**: Displays elapsed time for long operations

### File Analysis Progress
- **Analysis Progress Bar**: Visual progress bar during file analysis
- **File Counter**: Shows current/total files being processed
- **Current File Display**: Shows name of file being analyzed (verbose mode)

### AI Processing Progress
- **Search Progress**: Indicates when AI is analyzing files
- **Processing Stages**: Shows preparation, analysis, and response processing
- **Fallback Indicators**: Clear messaging when AI fails and falls back to pattern matching

## 🧪 Testing Progress Features

### Run Test Script
```bash
python test_progress.py
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test with verbose mode (shows all progress)
ipip --verbose "list all files"
ipip --verbose "list installer files"

# Test with normal mode (smart progress)
ipip "list all files"
ipip "list python files"

# Test AI progress with complex queries
ipip --verbose "list files with configuration in the name"
```

## 📝 Example Outputs

### Small Directory (< 10 files)
```bash
$ ipip "list config files"
📁 Files matching 'list config files' (2 found):

⚙️  config.json     Configuration file      1KB
⚙️  setup.cfg       Configuration file      512B
```

### Large Directory (10+ files, verbose)
```bash
$ ipip --verbose "list all files"
📁 Scanning directory: /path/to/project
⠋ Scanning... (547 checked) 89 files found ⏱ 00:01

⠋ Analyzing files... ██████████████████████████████ 100% 89/89 files ⏱ 00:03

🔍 Searching for files matching: 'list all files'
✅ Found 89 files using quick pattern matching

📁 Files matching 'list all files' (89 found):
[displays files organized by category]
```

### Complex AI Query
```bash
$ ipip --verbose "list files that might be installers or setup scripts"
📁 Scanning directory: /path/to/project
⠋ Scan complete 15 files found

🔍 Searching for files matching: 'list files that might be installers or setup scripts'
🤖 Using AI analysis for complex query...
⠋ Preparing file data for AI analysis...
⠋ Sending 15 files to AI for analysis...
⠋ Waiting for AI response...
⠋ Processing AI response...
✅ AI analysis complete: 4 files found

📁 Files matching query (4 found):
🔧  install.bat          Installation script     2KB
